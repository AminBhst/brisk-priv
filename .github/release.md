## Change Log
- Fixed some more browser integration bugs
- Fixed URL validation logic resulting in sometimes incorrectly determining valid URLs as invalid
- Other minor bug fixes

## Note
For this version, It is highly recommended to delete the Brisk directory located in the Documents directory then restart the app to prevent unexpected issues. By doing so, however, your unfinished downloads will be lost.

Windows: `C:\Users\User\Documents\Brisk`
Linux: `/home/user/Documents/Brisk`
